# Machine-Learning-Models-Prediction-of-Credit-Default-Risk
## Scope of the Project 
This project evaluates three machine learning models—SVM, a hybrid model (Logistic Regression + Extra Trees Classifier), and LightGBM—on the UCI Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset (30,000 observations), comparing them against Logistic Regression.

## Approach of the Modeling Training
The models were trained with feature selection, encoding, and scaling. They were assessed using ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings show a trade-off between accuracy and explainability: LightGBM is suitable for automated risk prediction, while the Hybrid Model offers a compromise for decision-making.

## Keywords
Credit risk, machine learning, classification models, financial decision-making, LightGBM, interpretability.
